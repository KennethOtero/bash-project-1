# IT 3038C - Bash Project 1

## What This Does
This is a bash script that reads a list of time zones from `USTimeZones.txt` and can convert the current time to the time zones within `EUTimeZones.txt` (e.g., EST to BST).

## How To Use It
Example Input (assuming it's currently 16:00):

`./script-sh -i EST -o BST`

Example Output:

`Thank you for using this script. You have converted 16:00 EST to 21:00 BST. These results have also been saved within the result.txt file.`
